**Keywords:** tensorflow, example. 

## 1. Introduction




## 2. Report Format

The report is written in (hugo) markdown and not commonmark. As such some features are not visible in GitHub. You can 
set up hugo on your local computer if you want to see how it renders or commit and wait 10 minutes once your report is 
bound into cybertraining.

To set up the report, you must first `replace` the word `hid-example in this example report with your hid. the hid will 
look something like `sp21-599-111`

It is to be noted that markdown works best if you include an empty line before and after each context change. 
Thus the following is wrong:

```
# This is My Headline
This author does ignore proper markdown while not using empty lines between context changes
1. This is because this author ignors all best practices
```

Instead, this should be 

```
# This is My Headline

We do not ignore proper markdown while using empty lines between context changes

1. This is because we encourage best practices to cause issues.
```

## 2.1. GitHub Actions
Description about my datasets

##Other people works
research that othe rpeople have done with the dataset

## 2.2. PAst Copy from Word or other Editors is a Disaster!

We recommend that you sue a proper that is integrated with GitHub or you use the commandline tools. We may include 
comments into your document that you will have to fix, If you juys past copy you will 

1. Not learn how to use GitHub properly and we deduct points
2. Overwrite our coments that you than may miss and may result in point deductions as you have not addressed them.

## 2.3. Report or Project

You have two choices for the final project. 

1. Project, That is a final report that includes code.
2. Report, that is a final project without code.
   
YOu will be including the type of the project as a prefix to your title, as well as in the Type tag
at the beginning of your project.

## 3. Using Images

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 4. Using itemized lists only where needed

Remember this is not a powerpoint presentation, but a report so we recommend

1. Use itemized or enumeration lists sparingly
2. When using bulleted lists use * and not - 
   
## 5. Datasets

Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub.
However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
the download function.

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.  

## 9. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
